/**
 *? Write a function in JavaScript that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

    Example:
    Input: "hello"
    Output: "olleh"
    Explanation:
    ** Given the input string "hello", the function should return the string with its characters in reverse order. Each character in the original string should appear in the opposite order in the output string. For instance, the first character of the input string becomes the last character of the output string, the second character becomes the second-to-last character, and so on.

    Additional Example:
    Input: "world"
    Output: "dlrow"
    In this example, the input string "world" is reversed to produce the output string "dlrow".

    This question requires you to think about how to manipulate strings in JavaScript and how to iterate through the characters of a string in reverse order.
